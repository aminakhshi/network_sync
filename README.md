## Neural network synchrony and traveling waves

Synchronization is a phenomenon observed in complex dynamical systems wherein interconnected subunits within a network (e.g., neurons in a brain, oscillators in a complex system) begin to oscillate or behave in a coordinated, rhythmic fashion.

## Usage Guidelines
